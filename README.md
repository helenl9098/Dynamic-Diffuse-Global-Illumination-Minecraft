This project is developed using the Realtime Vulkan Path Tracer (RVPT) developed [here](https://github.com/GraphicsProgramming/RVPT/) as a base. We set out to generate a real-time dynamic Minecraft-inspired scene illuminated by Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination (DDGI) Probes as described in [this paper](http://jcgt.org/published/0008/02/01/paper-lowres.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2cNCLVDNY9xtxjNy-7nIQiTScb0WEoV1IIRYvjfzq8fymEaz_n_m7PPCU).

## Features (work in progress)
 * Compute shader based Ray Tracing
 * Global Illumination Approximation with Light Probes
 * ImGui Integration
